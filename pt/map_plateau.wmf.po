"It is amazing how far one can see from the highest tower of the castle. We "
"can watch the whole island. So now I wonder why Lanissa did not see us and "
"thus did not prepare. Be that as it may, some things will never come to the "
"light of day. The only important issue at the moment are the opposing troops "
"still left. We have discovered enemy positions held by Erwyn to the north "
"and east of the castle. He is known to be a strong warlord and surely "
"commands the strongest warriors. In the south, we caught sight of some food "
"infrastructures guarded by Jomo – a younger warlord – and we should take "
"care of those infrastructures so we can take our cut of the food supply."
