msgid ""
"Build a coal mine and an iron ore mine. To do so, place a flag up on the "
"mountain’s flank to the east (on mountain terrain though, not mountain "
"meadow). When you click on the new flag, you can send geologists there. "
"Because the flag is on a mountain, the geologists will search for ores; "

msgid "In order to work, your miners need food."

msgid ""
"A hunter can hunt down animals, while a gamekeeper prevents them from "

"Other ways to produce food – different kinds of food – are fishers and "

msgid ""
"Workers gain experience by successful work. With enough experience, they "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Such buildings usually have greater demands than the basic kind of that "
"building – for instance, deep mines need snacks instead of rations. You will "
"have to enhance your tavern to an inn in order to produce snacks out of "
"pitta bread AND a second kind of food (meat or fish) AND beer. You may of "
"course enhance all mines to deep mines instantly given you have the workers "
"– bigger mines work a bit faster, smaller mines need cheaper food. It’s up "

msgid "Build a wood hardener"
msgstr "Construir um Endurecedor de Madeira"

msgid ""
"Bigger and better buildings – including all military ones – require better "

msgid ""
"You can obtain water by building a well upon a water source, which your "

"When roads are under heavy load for a long time, one carrier is usually not "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Today my hunters brought men, women and little children before me who had "

"While this is true, we should consider it later, for now other obstacles are "
