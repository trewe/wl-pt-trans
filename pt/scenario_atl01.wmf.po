"We spent the last week building two watchtowers on the mountains close to "

msgstr ""

msgid "Colionder is in Thought"

msgid ""
"Ahh, but I think this is impossible to change. The preparing and eating of "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But we might find a compromise in between: for me, making bread is a "

"helpful here. I for one would love to just have fresh bread delivered to my "
"house every day."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Oooh and even more important: the smoking of fish and meat to cleanse them "
"and improve their taste is terrible. My house is full of smoke and stinks "
"for weeks afterwards. Don’t you think that this could be done in a special "

"May Satul warm you, Jundlina. Have you considered mining for resources in "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The implications frighten me. Are there others on this island? Where are "
