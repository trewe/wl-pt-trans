"What has become of our Empire? I really ask this question – why did my king "
"forbid me from fighting against that monstrous barbarian tribe, who first "
"acted as a peaceful friend and then attacked my army in the darkest night?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With an army of 150 men, I was assigned to patrol on our northern frontier, "
"which lies near the Galdin Mountains in a great, beautiful and ancient "
"forest. Soon, we met a barbarian tribe, which at first was friendly. A few "
"of my men even traded with them and their kids came to us, to admire our "
"clean and tidy uniforms and weapons."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But during our fifth night in that region, they attacked us with no reason. "
"I lost dozens of good men, and found myself imprisoned and brought to their "
"chieftain. He spat at me, mocked me and told me to leave this land forever. "
"He did not want new land and did not want our land, but he told me that THIS "
"forest was their land – and it would stay theirs until the ghosts took the "
"last man of his folk!"

msgid ""
"Three weeks later, I returned to Fremil to speak with our king. He was "
"furious at the Barbarians, yet forbade any attack on these tribes. He "
"believed that our army was too weak to survive in a war against the "
"barbarians."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Still, I saw no way that I could erase my shame without fighting against "
"these barbarians. So, I left Fremil by boat to find a new world and a new "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Well, perhaps my fear is misguided, but it can’t be wrong to keep watch in "
"the forests – so that we can be sure to see any potential enemies before "

"Hey Lutius, I got the message that our first lumberjack has started his work "
"today. Perhaps it would be a good idea to wait until he cleans enough space "
"for constructing two more lumberjack’s houses, so that we can harvest the "
"logs faster."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But unfortunately the logs are useless for repairing our ship – we need "

"But that’s just about the only positive thing I know to talk about. The bad "
"news is that our lumberjacks harvest at an incredible speed. There are "
"almost no trees left on this island."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Lutius, these trees provide shelter from the sandstorms that sweep in from "
"the desert and shade on the hot days, and they are the home of so many "
