"Island Hopping is a traditional tournament in Atlantean culture. The rules "
"of the game are simple: you start with a headquarters on an island. When you "
"finish a castle at the end of the first island, you are granted a second "
"headquarters on a second island, which will contain all wares from your "
"first headquarters."

#
msgid ""
"If you finish a castle in the target area on the second island, you will get "
"a third headquarters on the third island. You must build a castle at the "
"center of the third island and hold it for 20 minutes to win the game."

"Whenever you finish an island, you will get bonus wares, depending on how "
"many players have finished the island before you. The earlier you finish, "
"the fewer wares you will get. See below for the details."

"The clue is that the first island only provides stones and wood, the second "
"only meadows and resources. The economies you leave behind will continue to "
"work for you, but you will only reap the benefits at the moment you reach a "
"new island."
